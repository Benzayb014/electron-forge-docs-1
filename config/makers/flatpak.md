# Flatpak

The Flatpak target builds [`.flatpak` files](http://flatpak.org/), which is a packaging format for Linux distributions that allows for sandboxed installation of applications in isolation from the rest of their system. In contrast, typical [deb.md](deb.md "mention") or [rpm.md](rpm.md "mention") installation methods are not sandboxed.

## Requirements

You can only build the Flatpak target if you have [`flatpak`](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-command-reference.html#flatpak), [`flatpak-builder`](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder-command-reference.html#flatpak-builder), and `eu-strip` _(usually part of the_ [_`elfutils`_](https://sourceware.org/elfutils/) _package)_ installed on your system.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @electron-forge/maker-flatpak
```

## Usage

To use `@electron-forge/maker-flatpak`, add it to the `makers` array in your [Forge configuration](../configuration.md):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  makers: [
    {
      name: '@electron-forge/maker-flatpak',
      config: {
        options: {
          categories: ['Video'],
          mimeType: ['video/h264']
        }
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

Configuration options are documented in [`MakerFlatpakConfig`](https://js.electronforge.io/classes/\_electron\_forge\_maker\_flatpak.MakerFlatpak-1.html#config).

## Debugging

For advanced debug logging for this maker, add the `DEBUG=electron-installer-flatpak*` environment variable.
